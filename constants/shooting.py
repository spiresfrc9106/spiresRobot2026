This module is for all the functions related to higher order shooting operations
This should include any mapping functions for distance,
compensation factors for shooting on the move, and any other functions that are used to calculate
the parameters for shooting commands, such as flywheel speed or hood angle, based on various inputs
such as distance to target, robot velocity, etc.
